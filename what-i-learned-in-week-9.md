### What I learned in week 9

**Flexbox**

Works through CSS to help aligning things in a grid easier. 

* Parents tell children where to go

* Parent is the flexbox

* Can only dictate if something is a row or column

* It is often important to keep things tidy in containers so you know where the CSS is having its effect.

Through the exercise 'Copy Ocelot' I learned that organization and planning are essential.

the command `justify` normally workers on a horizontal scale while `aligin` works on a vertical scale.  This can be reversed when reverse commands are used to change order.

### Responsive web-design
Considering how the webpage will change depending on the size of the screen is essential.

Pages need to be both responsive and adaptive.

Things to consider are how the page will react when a screen size is change manually or the page is viewed on a different device.

Some important tools to improve responsiveness:

* Relative values - percentages instead of pixels
* Breakpoints- So things like text or columns of items know where to break
* Min and max values - This prevents resolution on items like images to be stretched out too much
